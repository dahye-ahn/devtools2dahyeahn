	<h1>Yoga with Dahye</h1>
	<h2>Are you practicing everyday? </h2>
	<p> 
	As a <strong>health professional</strong>, I can't emphasize enough how yoga has helped me in my life. Many of my yoga students and clients ask me, "Can yoga help me lose wieght?" "Can yoga help me with my flexibility?" I can answer that question with my <strong>health</strong> science background. However, what I would really like to say is, <strong>yoga</strong> is so much more than that. It helps me control my appetite. It helped me with my <strong>injury</strong>. It helps me feel great about myself. It gives me so much energy and <strong>confience</strong>. It gives me enough challenge to have fun and, of course, to sweat out. It challenges my limit wherever my <strong>fitness</strong> level lies in. My purpose of teaching yoga comes from a hope that you try a yoga practice at least a few times to enjoy it, not to suffer, and to gain confidence and control in your life, not to discourage yourself..If some classes or poses too hard, you can either modify the pose for you or you can try different type of yoga. </p>

	<h2> I love chocolate </h2>
	<h3> 'Fat to fit' in my life</h3>
	<p>I will trade anything with any kind of chocolate sweets. Chocolate cake, chocolate cookies, cocolate icecream etc... You might not believe me when you see my 'good pictures'. In my most of 20s, I spent so much time and effort to lose fat or suppress diet. Sometimes, I win, and sometimes, fat wins. My weight has ranged from 103 lbs to 126 lbs. As a tiny person with 5'2" height, 20lbs going up and down is pretty much like a roller coaster. Sometimes I get <strong>stressed</strong> and just <strong>binge-eat</strong> until I feel sick. Many times, I lose control on my appetite. So I truly understand how hard it is to '<strong>eat healthy</strong> and <strong>stay fit</strong>' when my clients come in, wishing to be healthy and fit. Please don't get discouraged when you see other people's bikini pictures because none of us will post a bad bikini picture with belly fat. Anybody has ups and downs. If you need a help, ask for if and get advice. You are not alone in this 'fat to fit' fight. Remember, losing control on yourself from time to time is not so bad but not doing anything for yourself is a real bad! </p>
